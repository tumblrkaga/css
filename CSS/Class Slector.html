<span class="eliot"> Dear readers,</span><br> 
<p>For this year everything is said about waste management and recycling. 
We would like to thank you for your interest and your support and hope that you come back to our site in 2020.
We take a short break and will be back on January 7 with news and interesting stories. 
We wish you happy holidays and a good start into 2020.</p>

<p>The clip begins with Whoopi Goldberg saying, in an on-again off-again British accent, 
that the Washington Post made a list of gifts to avoid this holiday season, including mugs, scented candles, and wine. 
“But forget about that!” she says, before turning to her co-hosts, “What … do you WANT this year?”</p>

<p>Abby Huntsman pumps her hands up in triumph. Finally, she must be thinking, an experience. “For CHRISTMAS?” Meghan McCain must be thinking. 
Behind them, the screen fills with a picture of Behar holding a lasagna with the caption “THE JOY of LASAGNA.”
A chorus rises from the audience and starts singing “Joy to the World,” and servers in crisp white shirts bring out an individual, 
enormous tray of lasagna to each host. The women laugh, they look surprised. I black out and have to be resuscitated by kindly strangers, 
who tell me they found me writhing on the floor screaming, “AND YOU’RE ALL AT THE TABLE GETTING A LASAGNA.”</p>
